1. The design decisions I made are these:
In BufferPool class, I chose ConcurrentHashMap data structure to record the pages since it is thread-safe. My eviction policy is using a random generator to randomly evict one page.



In Catalog class, I created a private Table class to help manage the attributes.
In HeapPageId and RecordId class, I chose a prime number and use it to calculate the hashcode.
For other classes, I basically followed the instructions.

2. No changes to the API.

3. Completed all required code blocks, passed all unit tests.

4. Took about 24 hours to finish. The relations and IDs of tuple, page, file, table were confusing at first, but became clear along the coding.
